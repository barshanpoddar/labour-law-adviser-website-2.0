# labour-law-adviser-website-2.0
With this website i want to start a project for open-sources  contribution/contributors. With this, I want to give an web-site as a gift to Rishabh Jain and Mandeep Gill (Founder of LLA - Labour Law Advisor). Bqz, I often watch LLA's video on Youtube and I learn parsonal finance. When i come to visit LLA's website i figer out some problem, so i want to solve this problem. But with this Repositry i don't want to earn money or any other facility. It also applyed for all contributors...but any of those contributors can add this project on their Portfolio.
